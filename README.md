This plugin helps you to explore Aspose Java components inside your favorite IDE.
- Aspose New Project creates a new project by downloading and referencing libraries of Aspose Java components.
- Aspose New Project wizard allows you to select components from Aspose Java product lines like Aspose.Cells for Java and Aspose.Words for Java.
- Once specific component is selected, its reference is automatically downloaded from Aspose servers and referenced in classpath of the project.
- Once project is created using **New Project > Java > Aspose Application**, user can then add Aspose samples using **New File > Java > Aspose Example**.
- Available samples are displayed in tree format from where user can select one.
- Selected sample will be added to current project including source files and required data files.
- New created project is ready to debug/evaluate, all references are automatically added.
- With this plugin, you never need to check for new releases of Aspose components. Whenever a new release is published, you will be notified while creating project and you can also check release notes to save your time.
